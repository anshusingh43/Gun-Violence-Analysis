## Tableau Project
This is the visualization project where I tried to find some answer on the gun-violence dataset .

This dataset is taken from kaggle. It consist of 2M+ data from the year 2013-2018 for The United States of America( although there isn't much data from 2013 ). The datset includes features like -

1. Incident id
2. Date
3. State
4. Participant_gender
5. Participant_relationship
6. Number of killings ( N_killed )
7. Number of injuries ( N_injured )
8. Gun_type and so on.

The questions I am trying to answer is -

1. Start with very simple one, which states are worst affected by the gun violence?
2. What percentage of people get killed and does the number of killing increases with the increase in the incident reported?
3. Is there any particular pattern in year or months or may be days where gun-violence is increasing or decreasing?
4. Can we say that number of guns involved indicates high incident in that county or state?
5. How many percentage of time, the killer involved is the family person or someone related to the victims?
6. Does men attack female more or other-way-round.
7. Is there any common reason I can found in majority of the incidents reported?
and many more...

I have build a Tableau Dashboard and try to answer as many questions as I can.

I have my presentation too if you would like to check. I am still working on it, hopefully will find a lot of interesting facts and answewrs using this dataset.

Thank you for stopping by!
